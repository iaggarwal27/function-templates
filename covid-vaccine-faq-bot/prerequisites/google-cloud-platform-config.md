# Google Cloud Platform Account Configuration

This template uses Google Dialogflow to power the conversational chatbot agent that interacts with the user. To use the template, you will need to setup a Google Dialogflow project and configure it correctly by following the below steps: 
1. **Create a Google Cloud project [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate?previousPage=%2Fprojectselector2%2Fhome%2Fdashboard%3F_ga%3D2.179814308.187099110.1621977491-2130497986.1615817714)**. You will need to give your project a name and and select a billing account, organization, and location as applicable: 

![Create Google Cloud Project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4605360/120536608-27330600-c399-11eb-95cc-c82e6fe874a4.png)

 Once created, double check that [billing is enabled](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project) for your Cloud project. For more information on creating and managing Google Cloud Platform projects, please see this [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

2. **Enable Dialogflow API**. Visit [this page](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=dialogflow.googleapis.com) to enable the Google Dialogflow API by selecting your Project from the dropdown and clicking *Continue*:

![Enable Dialogflow API](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4605360/120537788-8f361c00-c39a-11eb-9e2b-af3293d135ae.png)

You should see a confirmation that the Dialogflow API was enabled. Then, click *Go to credentials*.

![Enable API Success](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4605360/120538437-5c405800-c39b-11eb-9a7a-0739cd1364c1.png)

3. **Create Service Account**. You will need a Service Account for Twilio to successfully authenticate with Google Dialogflow. You should have been redirected to the Create Credentials page. If not, [access it here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/wizard?api=dialogflow.googleapis.com).

Ensure that *Dialogflow API* is selected in the *Which API are you using?* dropdown. Then, select the *Application Data* radio button, and select *No, I'm not using them* when asked about Compute Engine, Kubernetes, etc as shown below:

![Create Credentials](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4605360/120538789-ca851a80-c39b-11eb-940f-683e4173aceb.png)

 Click *Next*. This will take you to the Create Service Account page. Give your Service Account a name and a description, then click *Create*:

 ![Create Service Account](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4605360/120539852-dfae7900-c39c-11eb-8c0a-a7953671419a.png)

**Important** â€” you must grant your Service Account access to your Google Cloud Project to successfully authenticate with Dialogflow. We recommend choosing the **Dialogflow Service Agent** Role to scope access just to what is needed:

You may want to scope user level access to the service account, but this step is optional and can be skipped. Click *Done* to create the Service Account. 

For more information on creating and managing service accounts, please see this [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts).

4. **Generate a JSON Authentication Key**. You will need to generate a JSON authentication key with your service account credentials so Twilio can properly authenticate with Dialogflow. From the [credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials), click on the service account you just created. 

Click on *Keys* from the top nav:

![Service Account Keys Nav](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4605360/120540827-f903f500-c39d-11eb-9cbe-805b95d82831.png)

Then, click *Add Key* --> *Create New Key* from the dropdown:

![Add Key](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4605360/120540973-218bef00-c39e-11eb-83d1-77db93a351ae.png)

When prompted, make sure that you select *JSON* as the Key Type and click *Create*:

![JSON key type](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4605360/120541142-5dbf4f80-c39e-11eb-8ec2-6df52eef2be4.png)

The JSON Authentication Key will then be downloaded to your local machine.

5. **Save JSON Authentication Key as a Private Asset**. 

_If you are deploying this template as a Code Exchange Quick Deploy App_

You will be asked to paste the contents of this JSON file when configuring your Quick Deploy app in the Code Exchange interface. The Code Exchange will automatically upload the JSON file as a private asset in the right place upon deploying the app.

_If you are deploying this template from the CLI_

Take the JSON file you just downloaded, and save it to a file named `service-account-key.private.json` under the `assets` directory for this function template. Here is a one-line command you can run from the root of the template directory to help do that:

```
mv path/to/downloaded/key.json assets/service-account-key.private.json
```
